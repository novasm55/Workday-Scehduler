# Work Day Scheduler

## Description
A simple, browser-based calendar application that allows a user to save events for each hour of the day. This app runs in the browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by jQuery.

This application uses the Day.js library to work with date and time.

## Features
- Current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
- Time blocks for standard business hours are presented when user scrolls down
- Each time block is color-coded to indicate whether it is in the past, present, or future
- Clicking into a time block allows the user to enter an event
- Clicking the save button for that time block saves the text for that event in local storage
- Upon refreshing the page, the saved events persist
